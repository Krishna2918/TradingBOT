FULLY FIXED Training Started: Fri, Nov  8, 2025 12:20 AM
PPO: ppo_wrapper_fixed.log | DQN: dqn_stable_final.log

ALL FIXES APPLIED:
✅ Iteration-based checkpoints (every 100 iterations)
✅ TimeLimit wrapper (1000 steps per episode)
✅ Wrapper attribute delegation (__getattr__)
✅ Episodes will complete properly

Configuration: CPU buffer (35% faster), Networks on GPU
Resource limits: 40% GPU, 20% RAM

PPO: First checkpoint at iteration 100, episodes complete after 1000 steps
DQN: Currently at episode 140/2000, reward improving (-60,253 from -63,362)

Both trainings will save checkpoints and continue overnight.
